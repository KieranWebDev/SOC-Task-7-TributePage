        <h2 class="article-title"> Remembering Rocky 45 years later</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">It’s been over 45 years since Sylvester Stallone boxed his way into our hearts as
          Rocky Balboa. The
          first
          film
          in what would be a decades-long franchise, which premiered on November 21 1976, went on to win the
          Oscar
          for Best Picture. Here, a tribute to the film’s most memorable moments.</p>

        <h3>The Rocky theme</h3>
        <figure class="float-right">
          <img class="img-1"
            src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ce-rocky-p046-1544556261.jpg"
            alt="Rocky boxing Apollo">
          <figcaption>Rocky boxing Apollo Creed</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The classical-sounding horns and low-key disco vibes of Bill Conti’s “Gonna Fly Now” quickly became
          the
          theme song for underdogs everywhere. The tune made it to the top of the charts and racked up an
          Academy
          Award nomination for Best Original Song.</p>
        <p>You can listen to the iconic theme tune <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioE_O7Lm0I4"
            target="_blank">here.</a>
        </p>

        <h3>"Yo Adrian!"</h3>
        <p>Rocky Balboa’s iconic bellowing of his love’s name left quite the legacy. Our sympathies to the
          Adrians
          of the world, who have suffered a lifetime of hearing “Yo, Adrian!” followed by chuckles. One
          consolation prize: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tc7H9s4PdSI" target="_blank">the
            beautiful
            end scene</a>, when Rocky and Adrian run to each other
          after the big fight.

        <h3>Punching carcasses</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y4Cg-ijDRA" target="_blank">Beating up on raw meat</a>
          is not a traditional
          training method employed by boxers. However, Rocky is low on
          resources, so he practices punches at his best friend Paulie’s place of employment, a meatpacking
          plant.
          It’s based on the experiences of the real inspiration for Rocky Balboa: Philadelphia boxing great
          Joe
          Frazier, who fought Muhammad Ali (a.k.a. Apollo Creed). Working out with cuts of beef and running up
          stairs
          was Frazier’s actual training regimen.</p>
        <h3 class="edit">Rocky’s “It Stinks” Monologue</h3>
        <p>Initially, Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith) refuses to train Rocky—until the boxer gets the chance
          to fight World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed, and Mickey wants in on the action. Rocky sees
          right
          through Mickey and lets out all his emotions, ending his tirade with one of the most quotable movie
          lines ever: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhwERykawlc" target="_blank">“It stinks!</a>
          “It
          stinks! This whole place stinks. You wanna help me out? Well,
          help me out! Come on, help
          me out, I’m standing here!”
        </p>

        <h3>Rocky and Adrian Ice-skating</h3>
        <p>Boy meets girl. Boy takes girl to an ice-skating rink on Thanksgiving Day, but it’s only open for
          another 10 minutes because it’s closing early. As girl skates shakily around the rink, boy trots
          alongside her and describes his fights. Rocky is a love story and sports story!</h3>
        </p>

        <h3>The Fight Scene</h3>
        <p>Described by Rocky’s promoter as “the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the
          ring,” it stands as one of the most intense fight scenes in movie history.</p>

        <h3>And Finally...The Training Montage!</h3>
        <p> Watching Rocky running through the streets of Philly, doing a one-arm push-up, and finishing in a
          victory
          fist-pump at the top of the stairs of the Philadelphia Art Museum: How can one not feel the
          adrenaline?
          How
          can one not feel that anything is possible? It’s inspiration, defined.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Warning: </strong>After watching the montage you'll be "eating lightning and crapping
          thunder!"
